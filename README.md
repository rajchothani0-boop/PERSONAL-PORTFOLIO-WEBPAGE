#DESCRIPTION:
This project is a personal developer portfolio website created to present my academic work and internship projects in a single organized web page. The aim of the portfolio is to provide a simple online profile where anyone can view my information, skills, and completed work without needing a separate resume file. The project mainly focuses on layout arrangement and content presentation rather than complex functionality.

The website contains sections such as About, Skills, Projects, and Contact. The About section briefly introduces me and describes my interest in web development. The Skills section lists the technologies I have learned during coursework and practice. The Projects section shows important works including Academix, Quest Window, Chat Application, and other small projects, each with a short explanation so visitors can understand their purpose. The Contact section provides basic contact details.

Navigation between sections is handled using page anchors, allowing smooth movement across the website without reloading. The site does not contain login systems, backend processing, or connected databases. It is purely a front-end informational website designed to practice how content should be displayed clearly to visitors.

The design is kept clean and readable. Simple colors, proper spacing, and consistent alignment help maintain a professional appearance without unnecessary visual effects. The layout automatically adjusts according to screen size so the same website can be viewed comfortably on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers.

While building this project, I practiced semantic HTML structuring, consistent CSS styling, and responsive layout techniques. I also learned how to organize information in a clear hierarchy so users can quickly understand the content. The main learning outcome was understanding how to present personal work in a structured and accessible format.

Overall, this project represents a beginner-level portfolio website that demonstrates personal information and projects using only front-end technologies.
